Initialization: Create a set of samples from an initial probability distribution.

Evaluation: Evaluate the fitness of each sample using the objective function being optimized.

Update: Update the current probability distribution by fitting it to the best samples.

Repeat: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a maximum number of iterations or a satisfactory fitness level.
