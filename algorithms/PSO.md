Initialization: Create a population of particles, each with a randomly-initialized position and velocity.

Evaluation: Evaluate the fitness of each particle using the objective function being optimized.

Update: For each particle, update its velocity and position based on its own previous best position and the previous best position of the entire population.

Repeat: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a maximum number of iterations or a satisfactory fitness level.
