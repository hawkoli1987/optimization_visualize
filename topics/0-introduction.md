## Personal Perspective on Optimization

1. Why this website?
- In my studies of Optimization, there is an abundance of academic resources available in the form of sophisticated mathematical derivations. These resources are often organized into specific methods or algorithms, providing a detailed account of their discovery and implementation methods, making them a useful starting point. 
- However, for end-users like myself seeking a suitable optimization method for a specific field of AI or Data Science, a more **concise description** of each method, **interactive visualizations** to quickly understand their behavior, and a **comparison of methods** to evaluate their performance would be beneficial.
- Two works that greatly influenced my work include:
  - a. [Professor Andrew Ning's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6pNSgoumyfNUw0T_dOv5g6QzDf6tHmq) and his book on Optimization, which provided me with a comprehensive overview of Optimization and valuable insights into key methods.
  - b. [Emilien Dupont's GitHub page](https://emiliendupont.github.io/2018/01/24/optimization-visualization/), which features an incredible 2D visualization comparing fixed-step gradient-based optimization algorithms. I have adopted a similar format and added additional functionalities and algorithms.

2. What is optimization?
- Optimization is to find the best solution among an infinite sea of possibilities. It is a dance between the mind and reality, where we seek to balance our aspirations with the limitations of the world. 

3. Cool things done by optimization.
- Artificial Intelligence: from the very fundamental of gradient-based neural network training, to hyperparameter tuning, to the "structure from motion" in Computer Vision and the state-of-the-art Reinforcement Learning algorithms like TRPO and PPO.
- self-driving cars: plan the routes and make realtime driving decisions.
- design fighter-jets: improve the lift and maneuverability, reduce the weight and drag.
- discover new drugs: balance the efficacy with toxicity and ease of synthesis.
- manage power grid: schedule the generation and consumption of power, taking into account cost, reliability, and environmental impact.

4. Less cool (in subjective sense) things done by optimization?
- find the route to deliver groceries to your door.
- place and schedule the advertisements on websites.
- design slot machines to make them more addictive.

5. Why optimization is more often minimizing than maximizing?
- _"Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away. -- Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry"_

6. Is the word 'optimization' related to optimism?
- Both stem from the Latin word for 'best', but optimization is the yin to optimism's yang - while optimism is about seeing the best in things, optimization is about making the best of things.
